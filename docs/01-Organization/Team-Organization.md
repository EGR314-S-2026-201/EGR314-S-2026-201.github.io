## Team Charter

> "ASU is a comprehensive public research university, measured not by whom it excludes, but by whom it includes and how they succeed; advancing research and discovery of public value; and assuming fundamental responsibility for the economic, social, cultural and overall health of the communities it serves." (ASU's Charter)

This charter was agreed upon because all of our team members value teamwork and effort, and it aligns with our team goals in the "Appendix: Team Organization Information" section. We created this charter to reflect both of those in a short, concise paragraph.
