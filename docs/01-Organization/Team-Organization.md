## Team Charter

> "Team 201 is a group committed to quality, consistency, and teamwork. We are devoted to creating exploration devices with exceptional functionality, accuracy, and efficiency: accomplishing our tasks with high effort and speed."

This charter was agreed upon because all of our team members value teamwork and effort, and it aligns with our team goals in the "Appendix: Team Organization Information" section. We created this charter to reflect both of those in a short, concise paragraph.

## Product Mission Statement

 > "Team 201's goal is to create an exploration device that can consistently and effectively perform the tasks it was created to accomplish.”

Our team agreed on this mission statement as it reflects the goal of this project, to create an exploration device of some sort. As of now, the exact details of this device have not been decided, so the product mission statement will have to be updated to reflect the new additions in the future.

## Other Organizational Information
