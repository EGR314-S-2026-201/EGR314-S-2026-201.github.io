| Project monitor   | Tracks the team's progress relative to the project schedule (Gantt chart) and keeps team members apprised of deadlines and project status |

### Role Assignment Process

* Roles will be assigned via a volunteer process.
* Roles will be reassigned every 2 weeks to ensure each team member has a chance to participate.
* Team members will help one another meet responsibilities by holding themselves and each other accountable. Additionally, team members with extra time on their hands will attempt to assist those who are falling behind.
* The team will remain vigilant of each others' performance to notice anyone struggling with their roles/responsibilities.
* If roles and responsibilities need to be adjusted, it can be worked out via discussion in the group discord.
* Assignment due dates, milestones, and tasks will be tracked in a specified discord channel by the project monitor.
* Technical responsibilities within each assignment will be decided via discussion by the assignment leader based on each member's skillset. The assignment leader will attempt to evenly distribute the work load among the team.

### Communication Procedures

Based on the information provided in the Team Member Communication Method, the group's primary method of communication will be Discord. We have created a server where we can easily send messages, images, and links. It is expected that all team members respond within a 2-day time frame. Instructor correspondence will be primarily done by the Assignment leader, and important information will be relayed back to the server.

### Meeting Schedule and Coordination

* The team will meet weekly at 3:00 PM on Mondays.
* It will be a virtual meeting via the group discord.
* Reminders for the meetings will be posted in the group discord.
* Changes to this schedule will be posted in the group discord as well.
* Accountability issues will be noted, and too many many result in a pink slip.
* Records of accountability / attendance will be noted in the minutes by the meeting recorder.

### Team Coordination & Accountability

* Assignments are submitted by the assignment leader after getting confirmation from the rest of the group via discord.
* To ensure that each team member has the knowledge and skill required, the team will assign themselves to tasks based on availability and skillsets. If a team member cannot complete a task, other team members should attempt to assist them.
* Feedback is to be taken into account by all team members and acted on accordingly. The most important (if not all) feedback from the design review will be copied into a designated channel in the group discord.
* Missed contributions/assignments/actions will be noted and discussed in the group discord. If a team member is repeatedly not contributing the assignments, the steps in Conflict Recognition & Resolution can be taken.
* If another team member is having difficulty completing a task, other team members should assist when they are able.
* Team members should attempt to reflect the values in the group charter. Anyone who deviates from these values will be addressed individually and asked to improve.

#### Conflict Recognition & Resolution

* Submission of pink slips is up to individual group members. If there is an issue that they feel is irreconcilable from within the group, they are able to submit a pink slip to the professor anonymously. As a submission of the pink slips is an individual action, any documentation of issues is up to the team member submitting the pink slip.
* Ideally conflicts within the group can be resolved internally through honest and civil communication. As long as the team follows the protocols outlined in the above sections, there should be no issues that need to be escalated beyond the group.
