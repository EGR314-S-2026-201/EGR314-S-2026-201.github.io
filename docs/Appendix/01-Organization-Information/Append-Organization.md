### Communication Procedures

Based on the information provided in the Team Member Communication Method, the group's primary method of communication will be Discord. We have created a server where we can easily send messages, images, and links. It is expected that all team members respond within a 2-day time frame. Instructor correspondence will be primarily done by the Assignment leader, and important information will be relayed back to the server.

### Meeting Schedule and Coordination

* The team will meet weekly at 3:00 PM on Mondays.
* It will be a virtual meeting via the group discord.
* Reminders for the meetings will be posted in the group discord.
* Changes to this schedule will be posted in the group discord as well.
* Accountability issues will be noted, and too many many result in a pink slip.
* Records of accountability / attendance will be noted in the minutes by the meeting recorder.

### Team Coordination & Accountability

* Assignments are submitted by the assignment leader after getting confirmation from the rest of the group via discord.
* To Ensure that each team member has the knowledge and skill required, the team will assign themselves to tasks based on availability and skillsets. If a team member cannot complete a task, other team members should attempt to assist them.
* Feedback is to be taken into account by team members, and acted on.
* Missed contributions/assignments/actions will be noted and discussed in the group discord. If a team member is repeatedly not contributing the assignments, the steps in Conflict Recognition & Resolution can be taken.
* If another team member is having difficulty completing a task, other team members should assist if they are able.
* Team members should attempt to reflect the values in the group charter.

#### Conflict Recognition & Resolution

> Submission of pink slips is up to individual group members. If there is an issue that they feel is irreconcilable from within the group, they are able to submit a pink slip to the professor anonymously. As a submission of the pink slips is an individual action, any documentation of issues is up to the team member submitting the pink slip.
> Ideally conflicts within the group can be resolved internally.
