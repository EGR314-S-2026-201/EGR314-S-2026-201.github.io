## Overview
**In a basic paragraph, what is the goal for our exploration device?** 

Keep in mind we have to have at least 1 sensor, 1 actuator, 1 human-machine interface and 1 bidirectional internet communication subsystem and the other 4 subsystems must fit into one of the above categories.

We will build an exploration rover that will be used for exploring environments typically recognized as dangerous for humans. The rover will explore water and/or land based environments and have a chassis with multiple motors to act as actuators for moving a basic chassis around the environment. The human-machine interface will act as a central controller for the chassis and modular subsystems which can be swapped out to meet parameters for missions of different natures.

**In a basic paragraph, who is our audience?**

Our audience are the corporations who use expendable drones/rovers in potentially hostile and unsafe environments. These groups will not be limited to missions of a single unique nature, but rather missions whose parameters can change significantly.
